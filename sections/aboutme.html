                <p>A long time ago in a town not too far away, I was born. After a privileged childhood raised in the suburbs of the bay area. I moved to San Diego for a few amazing years at UC San Diego. Now, I am experiencing corporate life and finding my way in the world like all 20-somethings.</p>
                <p>What follows is a descending timeline of some select life events which best illuminate me.</p>

                <h1 class = 'content-text'>Although they are times I thoroughly enjoyed, it wasn't overly different from High School. A flexible schedule, a bunch of unregulated, immature young adults and a lot of pressure to figure their life out. I definitely had more stress, less sleep, and a lot of new experiences. But I met my partner Chloe, got swept into the ultimate frisbee cult, and figured out my career path into data science.</h1>
